    "In the previous section, you measured the P300 in response to rare trials. During rare trials, participants need to inhibit a prepotent motor response (i.e. responding as if they saw a frequent trial). The need for motor inhibition is often said to generate a conflict signal. In scalp EEG, conflict signals are detectable as increases in non-phase-locked theta (4-8 Hz) power. In this final section, you will follow the steps as detailed in [Cohen & Donner (2013)](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00479.2013) to measure the theta signature of conflict in rare trials.\n",
