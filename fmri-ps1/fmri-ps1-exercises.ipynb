    "## Problem 3: Mis-modeling the HRF, Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In a brief write-up, [Grinband et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18775784) pointed out a potential methodological issue in how fMRI experiments involving reaction times (RTs) were being modeled. In electrophysiological studies, there is considerable evidence for neural activity up to the point of response. Many fMRI studies, however, were modeling reaction time trials uniformly, mapping the length of the neural boxcars to the trial length and not the RT length itself. This is problematic as modeling fast and slow RTs with identical HRF responses is potentially confounding changes in BOLD amplitude with changes in BOLD duration (i.e. time-on-task effect). Thus, [Grinband et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18775784) recommended a **variable epoch** approach, where RT trials were modeled with boxcars the length of the RT response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will demonstrate that the variable epoch approach can better recover true changes in the BOLD amplitude. We have simulated for you data from a simple rapid event related design experiment. The experiment is 320 total acquisitions with TR=2. There are two conditions with 80 trials each, and trials last 2s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the true BOLD signal change in both conditions is the assume (~1.25%). However, the response times across conditions differ: the average response time in the first condition is approximately 800ms, whereas the average response time in the second condition is approximately 1200ms."
